<a id="investing-rules" href="javascript:;" id="dropdown" target="_self"><b>Investing Rules</b></a>
<div id="instructions" style="display:none;">
    <p>A few quick beliefs that guide my investing acumen &ndash;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only invest in stocks or bonds. Real estate, gold, Bitcoin, etc. are all scams long-term.</li>
        <li>Insider trading is rampant. Never buy individual stocks. Only index funds like <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo#overview">VOO</a>.</li>
        <li>Work out if <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">interest rates</a> are rising or falling. When falling, dollar-cost average into VOO. When rising (like present), cash out and buy <a href="https://client.schwab.com/Areas/Trade/FixedIncomeSearch/FISearch.aspx/TreasuryAuctions">T-Bills</a> for a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_bill_rates&field_tdr_date_value_month={{ "now" | date: "%Y%m" }}#views-exposed-form-dfu-tool-page-dfu-page">4-5%</a> return over a year.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that the past 30 years of stock market returns have been predicated on globalization and good relations with China. Post-Trump, this may no longer be possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>"We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for <b>many years</b>. &nbsp;Higher interest rates lead to the economy running leaner, more geopolitical instability leads to more volatility, &nbsp;and increased regulation leads to slower growth and increased costs of innovation." &ndash; <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/">Mark Zuckerberg</a></blockquote>

<a id="political-views" href="javascript:;" id="dropdown2" target="_self"><b>Political Views</b></a>
<div id="instructions2" style="display:none;">
    <p>"The basis of society, of any society, is a certain pride in obedience. When this pride no longer &nbsp;exists, the society collapses." &ndash; <a href="ihttps://www.goodreads.com/notes/24457126-drawn-and-quartered/71655209-daniel-moore">Emil Cioran</a></p>
    <p>"In multiracial societies, you don't vote in accordance with your economic interests and social &nbsp;interests, you vote in accordance with race and religion." &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a></p>
    <p>"If you asked me any year what was the most important thing that happened that year, I probably &nbsp;would have no answer, but over five years' time the whole field changes." &ndash; <a href="https://web.cs.dal.ca/~eem/fea-knuth.pdf">Donald Knuth</a></p>
    <p>"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches &nbsp;to men of understanding, but time and chance happeneth to them all." &ndash; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209&version=KJV">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Historical statements I believe &ndash;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The 20th century's most influential people were Lyndon Johnson, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Richard Nixon, Deng Xiaoping, Nikita Khrushchev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Bill Clinton.</li>
        <li>In the 21st &ndash; Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, George W. Bush, Mark Zuckerberg, <a target="_blank" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, Joe Biden, and Satya Nadella<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNbyT7wPwk4" title="I've always felt like why is there such disparity today in the job, in the labor market between let's say some care worker and let's call it sort of a software developer. And it's because we think of, we as a society have decided to give it different, I'd say premium. Those premiums will adjust as some of these technologies really truly get diffused."></a>.</li>
        <li>Honorable mentions go to Ronald Reagan, Boris Yeltsin, Julius Rosenberg<a href="/assets/img/imgur/rosenberg.jpg" target="_blank"></a>, Qian Xuesen, Leonid Brezhnev, Indira Gandhi, Jiang Zemin, Ho Chi Minh, Adolf Hitler, and Albert Einstein.</li>
