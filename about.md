<a id="investing-rules" href="javascript:;" id="dropdown" target="_self"><b>Investing Rules</b></a>
<div id="instructions" style="display:none;">
    <p>A few quick beliefs that guide my investing acumen &ndash;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only invest in stocks or bonds. Real estate, gold, Bitcoin, etc. are all scams long-term.</li>
        <li>Insider trading is rampant. Never buy individual stocks. Only index funds like <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo#overview">VOO</a>.</li>
        <li>Check if <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">interest rates</a> are at long-term highs or lows. If low, dollar-cost average into VOO. When high (like present), cash out and buy <a href="https://client.schwab.com/Areas/Trade/FixedIncomeSearch/FISearch.aspx/TreasuryAuctions">T-Bills</a> for a 4-6% return over a year.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that stock market returns from 1991 to 2018 were predicated on globalization and good relations with China. Post-Trump, this may no longer be possible.</li>
        <li>The dollar's purchasing power is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SA0R">plummeting</a>, with a 20% loss since 2019. It's possible the only good long-term financial strategy is immigrating to a country with a weaker currency.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>"We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for <b>many years</b>. &nbsp;Higher interest rates lead to the economy running leaner, more geopolitical instability leads to more volatility, &nbsp;and increased regulation leads to slower growth and increased costs of innovation." &ndash; <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/">Mark Zuckerberg</a></blockquote>
    <blockquote>"There is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and fall of capital. All things entail rising and falling &nbsp;timing. You must be able to discern this." &ndash; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/31197112-the-book-of-five-rings/71655209-daniel-moore">Miyamoto Musashi</a></blockquote>
</div>

<a id="political-views" href="javascript:;" id="dropdown2" target="_self"><b>Political Views</b></a>
<div id="instructions2" style="display:none;">
    <p>"We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology." &ndash; E.O. Wilson</p>
    <p>"People, ideas, and hardware—in that order!" &ndash; John Boyd</p>
    <p>Historical statements I believe &ndash;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The 20th century's most influential people were Lyndon Johnson, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Richard Nixon, Deng Xiaoping, Nikita Khrushchev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Bill Clinton.</li>
        <li>In the 21st &ndash; Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, George W. Bush, Mark Zuckerberg, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, Joe Biden, and Satya Nadella.</li>
        <li>Honorable mentions go to Ronald Reagan, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Brezhnev, Indira Gandhi, Jiang Zemin, Qian&nbsp;Xuesen, Julius Rosenberg<a href="/assets/img/imgur/rosenberg.jpg" target="_blank"></a>, Ho Chi Minh, and Norman Borlaug.</li>
