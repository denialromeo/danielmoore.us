> Has everyone heard of Jack Handey’s “[Deep Thoughts](https://www.mit.edu/people/dmredish/wwwMLRF/links/Humor/Deep_Thoughts)”?  The joke is that it’s a stupid guy trying to say deep things, like “I’d rather be rich than stupid.”
<br> &mdash; Clayton Schwartz, [*2 Arms and a Head*](http://www.2arms1head.com/)

In the dot-com bust of the early 2000's, [more than one million jobs were lost](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/tech-layoffs-millennials-gen-x.html). It took 20 years for the job market to recover to the peak of the dot-com boom in 2021.

Since mid-2022, a new bust is upon us. At least [400,000](https://layoffs.fyi/) jobs have been lost. I suspect it might actually be much higher. My father was laid off with 5% of his company from his job in June 2023 (and effectively forcibly retired), but his layoff doesn't seem to have been publicly announced.

This new bust comes along at a fascinating point. Interest rates, which have been going down for my whole life, are suddenly back up to 1990's levels. Rent and food prices have skyrocketed.

The U.S. is losing allies left and right while previously joke groups like BRICS rise to prominence. Saudi Arabia has now joined the bloc, effectively signaling the imminent demise of the U.S. dollar.

ChatGPT has also revolutionized computer programming, allowing one motivated engineer to do the work of four or five. Remote work has also been proven feasible at scale by the pandemic.

Some predictions I have for the future U.S. job market &ndash;

Most of the world's problems are caused by there being too many excess males.

In our age of fossil fuels and artificial intelligence, we really don't need most men around at all. Women are intrinsically valuable (in part because they're naturally inclined to take orders rather than try to give them), but I've seen many good things (clubs, companies, countries) ruined because idiot males ran them into the ground to satisfy their egos or to humiliate other men.

Religions like Islam are actually built on humiliating men. "Islam" literally translates to "submission", and policies like polygamy and circumcision are explicitly designed to cut most males out of all wealth and power. This is the main reason why Islam expanded the way it did &ndash; war captives were the only way for poor men to find wives. It's a religion built on male sexual frustration.

All future children should be born through in-vitro fertilization, and only females should be born. There's probably enough frozen sperm to last for ten lifetimes, so we could get rid of men entirely, though maybe 10% of births could be male so that there's a leadership class.

As with most things, I think China will lead the way on this. To deal with their demographic crisis, they'll need to create more children. Those children will likely be majority female. It'll be great.

In her [dissent](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf) in *SFFA v. Harvard*, the 2022 Supreme Court case that banned affirmative action, justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the U.S. is "an endemically segregated society".

I can't stop thinking about this phrase &ndash; "endemically segregated society".

It's really spot-on. Workplaces are segregated (I legally changed my name so I wouldn't be forced into Indian-majority IT sweatshops). Dating and socializing are segregated. I receive poor service at restaurants if my waitress or cashier happens to be white.

Half a century after the de jure end of segregation, with a [majority](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/children-of-color-projected-to-be-majority-of-u-s-youth-this-year) of Americans under 18 now being non-white, white Americans still seem to champion an utterly obsolete racial identity.

Their insistence on this is ruining their own lives. Electing Trump directly caused a new Cold War and transfer of hegemony to China and Russia. Poisoning virtual and real-life spaces with hate mostly drives the whites themselves insane.

The younger white males even invent new racial slurs (e.g. "Pajeet"), which utterly baffles me. Insulting me will not improve your life. You cannot insult your way out of high cost-of-living. Outnumbering me means nothing if you cannot afford to live in my neighborhood.

There's an aphorism that hating others is like drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die. White Americans are an excellent example of this.

I think an accurate view of modern life might be as a series of nested prisons &ndash; penal, wage-based, nation-based, and biology-based.

So you have actual prisons, right? Where you're enslaved to perform free labor as punishment for breaking the law. But supporting that system is a wage-based prison of high costs, low salaries, and degrading, often pointless labor where the goal is escaping the system through "retirement".

Fail to maintain gainful employment (either by choice or because your profession was automated or offshored), and you wind up homeless. The penalty for homelessness is, you guessed it, prison.

Even if you're able to escape the above fates (by being born rich or getting lucky enough to start a successful business during a time of economic expansion), you're still trapped by your nationality.

If you're a citizen of a country that historically lost wars (e.g. India, Nigeria, Mexico), you're trapped in your country because the currency you earn is devalued against the currencies of nations that won wars (e.g. the U.S., European nations allied with the U.S.).

Even being in a historical winner isn't enough, since you have to keep winning. As the U.S. empire implodes, quality of life in the U.S. is fast approaching that of poorer countries (e.g. China has a higher lifespan than the U.S.). Being merely a millionaire here likely has diminishing returns.

So, to escape these prisons, you have to be born in the U.S., strike it big during a time of economic expansion, then take your winnings and leave for a poorer country trapped in the U.S. orbit (e.g. the Philippines). And you have to do this all before biological conditions make it impossible.

The horrific thing about being alive is that whatever you do or don't do, you will sooner or later die. If you're rich enough to avoid death by overwork or crime, you will still age into irrelevance as the world moves on and a younger, hardier set of people takes over.

So you're in a biological prison where you have to make all your moves and get rich or die trying between the ages of 20 and 40. Before 20, you're a slave of the school system; after 40, you're too weak to compete with the younger people gunning for your position.

And that's if you're lucky enough to spend your adulthood in a time of economic expansion. If you graduate into a recession (2001, 2008, 2022), you're dead before you even begin.

Fail to get rich (99% of people will fail) and you'll be forced into worse and worse jobs until you eventually die of old age while working as a greeter at Walmart and living in a car.

It's monstrous and inhumane. The above is why I refuse to have children. I imagine most people would mock the above as being too pessimistic, but my response is that you know I'm right &ndash; you just don't want to admit it.
