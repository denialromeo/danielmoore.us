With this guide, you're going to start with a computer connected to the Internet and end up with your own [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-generated website hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) like this one!

Maintaining a website is free, educational, and fun. You're in for a treat!

## Step 1: Installation

I assume you're using Windows. If you aren't, just replace Scoop with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

3. Open your command prompt (`Windows key`, type `cmd`, `Enter`) and install [Scoop](http://scoop.sh) --

    ```bash
    powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
    powershell iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
    ```

3. Use Scoop to install Git, Make, MSYS2, Ruby, and Wget, then configure Git.

    ```bash
    scoop install git
    scoop bucket add versions extras
    scoop install make msys2 ruby27 wget
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "Your E-mail"
    ```

    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is how you'll push your website to Github Pages.
    * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) lets you run makefiles, which simplify commands.
    * [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) helps with installing Ruby gems on Windows.
    * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is the language Jekyll is written in. You'll use [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) to install Jekyll.
    * [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) lets you download files from the Internet through the command prompt.

4. Close and re-open the command prompt, then install Jekyll.

    ```bash
    gem install jekyll
    ```

5. In this tutorial, we're going to use a makefile. Here's what it contains --

    ```bash
    g:
        git add --all .
        git commit -m "New website commit."
        git push origin master

    l:
        jekyll build
        jekyll serve --incremental --port {{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}
    ```

    When placed in the directory containing your website, this will enable two commands --

    * `make g` will push your website to Github Pages for public view.
    * `make l` will run your website on your own computer at [http://localhost:{{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}](http://localhost:{{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}).

## Step 2: Running Locally

Go ahead and browse through the large selection of themes at [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/), pick one you like, and navigate to its Github repo. (My favorite is [DentistSmile](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/dentistsmile/).)

Clone your theme, enter the new directory, download the makefile, and serve!

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/gabrsar/dentistsmile"
cd dentistsmile
wget "{{site.url}}{{page.makefile_path}}"
make l
```

Now visit [http://localhost:{{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}](http://localhost:{{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}). Voila! 

If `make l` failed, here's a few trouble-shooting tips.

1. Google the error message and install any missing gems with `gem install <gem>`.

2. Some Jekyll themes use [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), so if needed, run `gem install bundler`, then `notepad makefile` and edit to `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --port {{ site.jekyll_tutorial_local_port }}`.

3. Run `notepad _config.yml` and add the line `exclude: [vendor]`.

## Step 3: Going Public

Create and sign into a [Github](https://github.com) account.

Create new repository `<your username>.github.io`, then return to your command prompt.

Remove the existing local repository, start a new one, point it to Github, and push to remote.

```bash
rmdir /s /q .git
git init
git remote add origin "https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io"
make g
```

Wait a minute, then visit `<your username>.github.io` in a browser. Your website should be live! From now on, to update your public website, just run `make g`.

(You can get Git to remember your Github credentials by running one of the commands [here](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).)

Phew! That was a wild ride, but you now have your own website!

A few final tips --

* You should develop for yourself locally by running `make l` and reserve `make g` for when you want to make changes public.

* Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Be familiar with both and read Jekyll's [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

* Get comfortable with a text editor. I like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Consider learning [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

* Jekyll was written by Tom Preston-Werner, the founder of Github. For a cool bit of history, check out his [blog post](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) announcing his invention.
