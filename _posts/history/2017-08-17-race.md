  Just be good to people you meet, and avoid tribalism. That's about all you can do.

> Just as a white man has different skin color from a black man, so it is quite possible that he also has a somewhat different mind. But given what we know of evolution, it is not very likely. The evolutionary pressures that have shaped the human mind—principally competitive relations with kin members, tribal allies, and sexual partners—are and have been the same for white and black men and were at work before the ancestors of whites left Africa 100,000 years ago. While skin color is affected by things such as climate, which differs markedly between Africa and northern Europe, the shape of the mind is affected only very marginally by nonhuman problems such as what kind of game to hunt or how to keep warm or cool. Infinitely more important is how to deal with fellow human beings, and that is the same problem everywhere.

Hey, {{ site.nickname }}, what's your race?

My parents are from [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), India. However, DNA testing [shows](http://ancstry.me/2wSTzVg) I'm part Asian and [Melanesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians). So, like everyone else, I'm mixed.

Most non-white Americans have been abused (e.g. [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States), [relocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal), [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation), [internment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans)), so&nbsp;Americans are conditioned by decades or centuries of propaganda to label and mistreat them. Race is a [product of violence](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/#main-content), a contrived excuse for theft and murder.

But Indian-Americans have never been subject to a hate campaign by the American government, and I feel tolerated for who I am. I&nbsp;love America, and there's little I wouldn't do for my country.

I'm Indian-American. Any advice?

Try to see the world through a historical lens.

Here is a truncated history of modern American racism -

After the Civil War ended in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was murdered by an assassin. His vice president, Andrew Johnson, reversed many of the gains of the war. Black people went from slaves to criminals, Native Americans were wiped out completely, and Asians were refused citizenship.

All this only changed in 1963, when President Lyndon Johnson took power. He pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibiting workplace discrimination), the Immigration Act of 1965 (allowing mass immigration from non-European countries), the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (granting non-whites the vote), and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ending segregation).

Unfortunately, President Johnson also started the very unpopular Vietnam War, which was why he declined to run for a second term. His vice president, Hubert Humphries, was defeated in a landslide by Richard Nixon, who started the mass incarceration of black Americans through the "War on Drugs". This policy was continued in earnest by presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.

Once you start thinking in terms of events, everything starts to make sense. Try to answer this question - What were the long-term impacts on racial dynamics of presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump? Do you have any idea?

We're too few in number to have any real future in this country.

This is by design. Racist per-country immigrant quotas maintained in the [Immigration Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965#firstHeading) mean we'll always be a negligible proportion of the U.S. population.

Especially with [recent slowdowns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/28/joe-biden-is-overseeing-one-largest-cuts-legal-immigration-history/) in immigration, we can expect the Indian-American community to dissolve within a generation or two.

Keep in touch with the motherland. Try to spend a few months or years there. Make sure you apply for your [OCI](https://services.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/ind/apply-oci-services) if you don't have it already. Be good to yourself and to your people.
