Race issues [caused our bloodiest war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War), and [still make headlines daily](https://news.google.com/search?q=racism).

  We have over two million prisoners, disproportionately black, [making our goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States).

  The [prison-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex) has transformed our criminal justice system since the 1970's. [Fewer than five percent of criminal cases go to trial](http://web.archive.org/web/20181002152225/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/11/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/), so [many prisoners may be innocent](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/40848160-punishment-without-crime/71655209-daniel-moore).

* <p>What can you do?</p>{:.subsection}

  Just be good to people you meet, and avoid tribalism. That's about all you can do.

  > It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one's life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than "Try to be a little kinder". &mdash; Aldous Huxley

> Just as a white man has different skin color from a black man, so it is quite possible that he also has a somewhat different mind. But given what we know of evolution, it is not very likely. The evolutionary pressures that have shaped the human mind—principally competitive relations with kin members, tribal allies, and sexual partners—are and have been the same for white and black men and were at work before the ancestors of whites left Africa 100,000 years ago. While skin color is affected by things such as climate, which differs markedly between Africa and northern Europe, the shape of the mind is affected only very marginally by nonhuman problems such as what kind of game to hunt or how to keep warm or cool. Infinitely more important is how to deal with fellow human beings, and that is the same problem everywhere.

Hey, {{ site.nickname }}, what's your race?

My parents are from [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), India. However, DNA testing [shows](http://ancstry.me/2wSTzVg) I'm part Asian and [Melanesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians). So, like everyone else, I'm mixed.

Most non-white Americans have been abused (e.g. [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States), [relocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal), [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation), [internment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans)), so&nbsp;Americans are conditioned by decades or centuries of propaganda to label and mistreat them. Race is a [product of violence](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/), a contrived excuse for theft and murder.

But Indian-Americans have never been subject to a hate campaign by the American government, and I feel accepted for who I am. I&nbsp;love America, and there's little I wouldn't do for my country.
