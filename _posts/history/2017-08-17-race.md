Race issues [caused our bloodiest war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War), and [still make headlines daily](https://news.google.com/search?q=racism).

### Racism Today

* <p>Mass incarceration</p>{:.subsection}

  We have over two million prisoners, disproportionately black, [making our goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States).

  The [prison-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex) has transformed our criminal justice system since the 1970's. [Fewer than five percent of criminal cases go to trial](http://web.archive.org/web/20181002152225/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/11/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/), so [many prisoners may be innocent](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/40848160-punishment-without-crime/71655209-daniel-moore).

* <p>What can you do?</p>{:.subsection}

  Just be good to people you meet, and avoid tribalism. That's about all you can do.

  > It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one's life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than "Try to be a little kinder".

> Just as a white man has different skin color from a black man, so it is quite possible that he also has a somewhat different mind. But given what we know of evolution, it is not very likely. The evolutionary pressures that have shaped the human mind—principally competitive relations with kin members, tribal allies, and sexual partners—are and have been the same for white and black men and were at work before the ancestors of whites left Africa 100,000 years ago. While skin color is affected by things such as climate, which differs markedly between Africa and northern Europe, the shape of the mind is affected only very marginally by nonhuman problems such as what kind of game to hunt or how to keep warm or cool. Infinitely more important is how to deal with fellow human beings, and that is the same problem everywhere.

### Questions

Hey, {{ site.nickname }}, what's your race?

My parents are from [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), India. However, DNA testing [shows](http://ancstry.me/2wSTzVg) I'm part Asian and [Melanesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians). So, like everyone else, I'm mixed.

Most non-white Americans have been abused (e.g. [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States), [relocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal), [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation), [internment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans)), so&nbsp;Americans are conditioned by decades or centuries of propaganda to label and mistreat them. Race is a [product of violence](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/), a contrived excuse for theft and murder.

But Indian-Americans have never been subject to a hate campaign by the American government, and I feel tolerated for who I am. I&nbsp;love America, and there's little I wouldn't do for my country.

I'm Indian-American. Any advice?

Post-Obama/Trump/COVID/Biden/Xi/Putin, there's been a noticeable shift in U.S. racial dynamics. "Whiteness" is no longer a marker of high status.

Yet there is still stigma against non-Western cultures. Resumes with non-white names are [routinely&nbsp;filtered out](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf), and with an Indian name, you are likely receiving far fewer interview requests than you should be. You're being cheated out of the career you deserve.

So, at the risk of insulting my friends and neighbors, the easiest path to leading a good life as an Indian-American is probably a [legal name change](https://www.legalzoom.com/personal/marriage-and-divorce/name-change-overview.html). It worked for me.


{:.questions}
I'm Indian-American. Any advice?

Many of your personal/professional problems are probably related to racism.

A good first step to overcoming them is to get your mental health in order. Many of us have an inferiority complex, which is understandable given how the past few centuries have played out.

An easy way of overcoming this is to undertake what I call a "racial detox".

Simply stop watching any films/videos/etc. made by or starring whites. Watch strictly Korean/Indian/Chinese/African/Mexican/black American/etc. media for a week.

If you feel better at the end of it, try making the detox permanent. The world is changing, and the old white supremacist ways are swiftly becoming irrelevant. It's best to be ahead of the curve.
